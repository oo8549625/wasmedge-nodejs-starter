# Getting started

![Build and test](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-nodejs-starter/workflows/Build%20and%20test/badge.svg)

[Fork this project](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-nodejs-starter/fork) to create your own Rust functions as a web service.

## How it works

* The Rust function source code is in the `src/lib.rs` file.
* Use the [rustwasmc tool](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/rustwasmc/) to compile the Rust function into a WebAssembly module in the `pkg` directory.
* Optional: Use the `node node/app.js` command to test the function locally in Node.js.
* Upload the `pkg/*.wasm` file to the [Second State FaaS service](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-function-as-a-service-in-rust/), OR to a [Node.js server](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/), to turn it into a web service.

## Setup

It is easy to use our `appdev` Docker image to run the dev environment. You can choose from `x86_64` or `aarch64` versions of the image. Alternatively, you could also use Github Codespaces to run the following example.

```
$ docker pull wasmedge/appdev_x86_64:0.8.2
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app wasmedge/appdev_x86_64
(docker) #
```

## Build

Use the `rustwasmc` command to build the Rust function into a WebAssembly bytecode file.

```
(docker) # cd /app
(docker) # rustwasmc build
```

## Test and debug

From the first terminal window, start the Node.js application.

```
(docker) # node node/app.js
```

From a second terminal window, you can test the local server.

```
$ curl http://localhost:3000/?name=WasmEdge
hello WasmEdge
```

### Optional: Upload to the FaaS and test

Upload the wasm file in the pkg folder to the FaaS. Double check the .wasm file name before you upload.

```
(docker) # curl --location --request POST 'https://rpc.ssvm.secondstate.io:8081/api/executables' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
--header 'SSVM-Description: say hello' \
--data-binary '@pkg/hello_lib_bg.wasm'
```

The FaaS returns

```
{"wasm_id":161,"wasm_sha256":"0xfb413547a8aba56d0349603a7989e269f3846245e51804932b3e02bc0be4b665","usage_key":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","admin_key":"00xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4adc960fd2b8"}
```

Make a function call via the web.

```
(docker) # curl --location --request POST 'https://rpc.ssvm.secondstate.io:8081/api/run/161/say' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw 'Second State FaaS'
hello Second State FaaS
```

You can easily incorporate this web service into your HTML web pages. [See how](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-function-as-a-service-in-rust/#web-ui)
